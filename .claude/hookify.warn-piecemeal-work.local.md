⚠️ **Before stopping, check: Did you complete the user's FULL request?**

The user has said in this project:
- "when all summry then why quiz send" (I gave summary, why ask more?)
- "this is last fininsh time . so not a single option for dovlerper hire"
- "why . when i will all rules all are explain you have summry then why this is"

**User explains the full scope upfront. Do ALL items in one pass.**

Check before stopping:
- [ ] Did the user list multiple items? Did you do them all?
- [ ] If user said "finish all", did you actually finish all?
- [ ] Are there items from their summary table/list still incomplete?

If anything from the user's list is incomplete AND they said "all" or "full" or "finish" — keep working, don't stop.
